## Bay Order List Tracker (BOLT)
An application to organize and order a list of bays for Home Depot's MET team.

## How does this help Home Depot's MET team?
MET associates are in charge of finishing a certain amount of bays every week. Throughout the day, MET associates help customers and organize the store. BOLT provides data on the time it takes to get a bay done, when the bay was last serviced, and what level of traffic is going to that bay. For MET associates, these data points are important because it helps strategize what bays should be done and in what order. This increases efficiency in finishing the weekly bay list for MET team.
 
## Functionality
BOLT is essencially a list that allows you to add, delete, search, and sort items within the list. In this case the items on the list are bays, with each bay containing a bay number(e.g. 01-002, Z8-097 ), traffic level (e.g. high, medium, low), time given to complete, and how long since it was last serviced. 

## How do I add to the list?
Under the header, there is a long tab the has a plus sign (+) with "Add Bay" to the right of it, if you click the tab it will give you a dropdown form. The form will take inputs based in the attributes of the bay. When you finish the form, click the add bay button in the lower right corner of the dropdown form and it will submit the inputs and add a new bay on the list.

## How do I delete bays on the list?
In the list of bays to the left side of each column, there is a red button with an "x" inside of it. Clicking the button will delete the bay from the list.

## How and what can I search in the list? 
Under the adding section of the program, there is a search bar. The search bar is only allowed to search two things, the bay number and the traffic level. This because just need to identify the bay numbers and the traffic level, it doesnt need to be sorted.

## How and what can I sort in the list?
Connected to the right of the search bar is a button that has "Sort By:" inside it. This button will display a dropdown in what you are allowed to sort (e.g. Last Serviced, Time ), and in what order (e.g. Ascending, Descending). This feature is what makes this application special. You are able to sort the time it takes to get a bay done, and finding out when it was last serviced. This benefits associates in knowing what order should their list be done.

## Use Case Scenario #1
MET team just finished warming up and are about to start on work. The MET Supervisor wants the whole team to work in the hardware departments because it is very high in customer traffic and in the mornings customers dont start coming in until 8a.m. giving the team time to work on the bays efficiently without customer traffic to bother them.

## Use Case Scenario #2
MET associate Carlos was assign to do aisle 6 within his list of bays, but several of the bays are having a project to remodel the bay. This means too many people are working in the aisle as once, Carlos can now delete the bays are were supposed to be done in the aisle and the MET Supervisor can add in new bays for Carlos to do in the day. 

## Use Case Scenario #3
The team has not finished the hardware department but it is 8 a.m. and more customers are starting to come. The MET Supervisor decides to take the team to areas where traffic is low, and time to spent on the bay is high. The MET Supervisor searches for low traffic bays and sorts them into descending order to see the longest to shortest times on low traffic bays.

## Bay Order List Tracker (BOLT)
An application to organize and order a list of bays for Home Depot's MET team.

## How does this help Home Depot's MET team?
MET associates are in charge of finishing a certain amount of bays every week. Throughout the day, MET associates help customers and organize the store. BOLT provides data on the time it takes to get a bay done, when the bay was last serviced, and how much customer traffic is around the bay. For MET associates, these data points are important because it helps strategize what bays should be done and in what order. This increases efficiency in finishing the weekly bay list for MET team.
 
## Functionality
BOLT is essencially a list that allows you to add, delete, search, and sort items within the list. In this case the items on the list are bays, with each bay containing a bay number(e.g. 01-002, Z8-097 ), traffic level (high, medium, low), amount of time to complete, and how long since it was last serviced. 

## How do I add to the list?
Under the header, there is a long tab that has "+ Add Bay", if you click the tab it will give you a dropdown form. The form will take inputs based in the attributes of the bay. When you finish the form, click the add bay button in the lower right corner of the dropdown form and it will submit the inputs and add a new bay on the list.

## How do I delete bays on the list?
In the list of bays to the left side of each column, there is a red button with "x". Clicking the button will delete the bay from the list.

## How and what can I search in the list? 
Under the adding section of the program, there is a search bar. The search bar is only allowed to search two things, the bay number and the traffic level. 

## How and what can I sort in the list?
Connected to the right of the search bar is a button that has "Sort By:". This button will display a dropdown in what you are allowed to sort (Last Serviced or Time ), and in what order (Ascending or Descending). 

## Use Case Scenario #1
It is 5 a.m., MET team just finished warming up and are about to start on work. The MET Supervisor wants the whole team to work in the hardware departments because it is very high in customer traffic and customers dont come in until 6 a.m.. giving the team extra time to work on the bays efficiently without customer traffic to bother them.

## Use Case Scenario #2
MET associate Carlos was assign to do aisle 6 within his list of bays, but there is a project in the aisle and little space to work. Carlos deletes the bays are were supposed to be done in the aisle and the MET Supervisor can add in new bays for Carlos to work on. 

## Use Case Scenario #3
The team has not finished the hardware department yet alot of customer traffic start filling the aisle. The MET Supervisor searches for low traffic bays and sorts them into descending order to see the longest to shortest times on low traffic bays.
